*There are files outside this folder you should leave alone if you want password protection.*

Your home page ***must*** be called **index.html**.

You can clone this to a desktop too, however Admin will be needed to allow the server apps.

## Password protection

This site structure is password protected, as some sites may contain images of students.

If your site **does not** contain images of students, or sensitive information (names etc) then you can remove the password files and just create a site in the folder.

## Web Server Apps

These two little applications should be moved to your desktop

### ***Important***

You may need to relax your security for applications in your Security Preferences to allow the apps to run.
